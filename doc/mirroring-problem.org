#+title: The Mirroring Problem

This article describes the mirroring problem that =viooh-mirror= solves.

Many mirroring tools for Kafka have been built before the
*Schema-Registry* even existed thus they don't keep into consideration
the schemas themselves.

* The scenario

Let's assume that:

- We have two clusters: =kafka-src= and =kafka-dst=
  respectively the source and the destination of the mirroring process.

- Each cluster has an independent *Schema-Registry* installation.

- The topic to be mirrored is called =src-topic= from the =kafka-src=
  cluster, and it needs to be mirrored into the =dst-topic= of the
  =kafka-dst= cluster.

- The subject =src-topic-value= tracks the schemas for the
  =src-topic=, while the subject =dst-topic-value= tracks the schemas
  for the replicated topic =dst-topic=.

A naive mirroring tool might not even know the existence of the
*Schema-Registry* and just follow a mirroring which is based on the
messages in the topic.

In the picture above the =src-topic= has three messages all from
=version 1= of the schema.

As the tool read and deserialises the messages and then re-serialises
the messages for the destination cluster it will follow the standard
producer process. For example, if the configured serialiser for the
destination is =io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer=,
then it will contact the destination schema registry and attempt to
retrieve the ID for the =v1= schema. If this schema is not registered
in the destination schema registry it will register it, return the id,
and serialise the message with the new schema id into =dst-topic=.

So far so good, this is what most of the Kafka replication tools do.

* The Problem

The problem that most of the mirroring tools do not consider is that
the sequence of the messages might not be the same as the sequence of
the registered schemas.

The above picture shows the same scenario but now we have more
versions of the schemas.

In the source subject =src-topic-value= we have three version of the
same schema: =schema-v1=, =schema-v2= and =schema-v3=. For the sake of
the example we will assume the compatibility level is
=FORWARD_TRANSITIVE= (the problem exists with all level except with
the compatibility level =NONE=).

The schema compatibility dictates a specific evolution order of the
schemas, for example the version =v2= of the schema will need to have
all the fields of =v1= plus some new fields, and the version =v3= will
have all the fields of =v1= and =v2= and some additional ones.  The
=FORWARD_TRANSITIVE= compatibility dictates that each new schemas will
only have new fields as it is not allowed to remove existing
fields. This particular compatibility level will allow to update
Producers before you update consumers.

Messages in the =src-topic= can be of any version of the registered
schemas. For example, the topic shows the sequence: a message with
schema =v1=, followed by a message with schema =v3= and then a message
with schema =v2=.

A naive mirroring tool will consume the messages in order and push them
in the same order to the destination topic without considering the schemas.
So here is what will happen in this specific scenario:

  - The first message with the schema =v1= will be replicated and the
    =schema-v1= registered in the target schema registry.
  - The second message with schema =v3= will be replicated and the
    =schema-v3= registered in the target schema registry. This will
    work because the =schema-v3= contains all the fields of
    =schema-v1= and more, so it is =FORWARD_TRANSITIVE= compatible.
  - When the mirroring tool attempts to save the third message with
    =schema-v2= it will attempt to register the schema into the
    destination schema registry but *FAIL*!!!  The reason of the
    failure is that the =schema-v2= has *less* fields than the
    =schema-v3= thus breaking the =FORWARD_TRANSITIVE= rules.

* The =viooh-mirror= solution

=viooh-mirror= was designed to understand that the sequence of schemas
*must* be preserved in the target schema registry.

In the same scenario, when the =viooh-mirror= find a new schema (which
hasn't seen before), it will compare the source subject and the
destination subject and register *ALL* missing schemas in the exact
order that they appear in the source subject.

So if the =dst-topic-value= subject is empty, of the first message consumed
it will replicate *ALL* the source schemas for that subject into the destination
preserving the relative order.

If =schema-v1= was already present but not =v2= and =v3=, when it
reads the second message with schema =v3=, it will realise that this
is a new schema and replicate *in order* the =schema-v2= followed by
=schema-v3= in the target subject.

It uses caches to make this process efficient and it doesn't need
constantly check against the schema-registry.

Since the relative order of the schema is maintained as well, the
mirroring tool will be able to successfully mirror the messages and
maintain a mirror of the schemas as well.

This process is fully automated and it will also work if the source
schema changes over time.
